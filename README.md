The objective of this project is to generate a multiplayer real time strategy game that runs on the browser. It can 'build' using various tools, but it needs to produce a single html file which can be shared with no dependencies. Up to ten users who have this file should be able to play a game. There will be one 'host.' They will have the same html file as everyone else, nothing special - they will be the user who clicked 'host' and generates a link for others to play. This should work without a domain name, through websockets.
